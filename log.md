The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: 5/16/17

**Today's Progress:**
Practiced using Flexbox.

**Thoughts:**
Having a different class tag for every item seems like overkill.  Is there a better way to organize my css?

### Day 2: 5/17/17

**Today's Progress:**
Workout-maker, can now add exercises to a workout.  Delete exercise button renders but doesn't function yet.  Also did some refactoring.

**Thoughts:**
Refactoring wasn't as bad as I anticipated.  Yay for modular code.

### Day 11: 5/26/17

**Today's Progress:**
Connected dog-hikes react app to firebase.  It can read a datapoint from the db, update state on data change and re-render.

Next step, saving actual data to the db.

### Day 12: 5/27/17

### Day 13: 5/28/17 

**Today's Progress:**
Read Firebase docs and did some testing.

**Thoughts:**
Why is saving a string different from saving an object?

**Link to work:**


### Day 14: 5/29/17

**Today's Progress:**
More Firebase debugging.

**Thoughts:**
Why?...

### Day 15: 5/30/17

**Today's Progress:**
Made a CSS dog :-)

### Day 16: 5/31/17 

**Today's Progress:**
Got Dog Hikes site to push info to firebase.

**Thoughts:**
Firebase stores arrays as objects.  It doesn't like undefined/null values or empty arrays.  Makes sense.

### Day 17: 6/1/17

**Today's Progress:**
Watched watch and code and learned more about automated testing and test-driven development.

**Thoughts:**
Not really coding, but letting it slide this time...

**Link to work:**

### Day 18: 6/2/17 

**Today's Progress:**
Added react router to Dog Hikes site.  Can switch between adding a hike, a hike list and hike details.  The hike list and details components render placeholder divs for now.

**Thoughts:**
Spacing is a little weird, need to look at the css again.

### Day 19-62: 6/12/17 - 8/10/17

**Progress:**

**Thoughts:**
Finding a compromise between giving myself credit for coding, but not too much as I have not kept up with logging here.
