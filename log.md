The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: 5/16/17

**Today's Progress:**
Practiced using Flexbox.

**Thoughts:**
Having a different class tag for every item seems like overkill.  Is there a better way to organize my css?

### Day 2: 5/17/17

**Today's Progress:**
Workout-maker, can now add exercises to a workout.  Delete exercise button renders but doesn't function yet.  Also did some refactoring.

**Thoughts:**
Refactoring wasn't as bad as I anticipated.  Yay for modular code.
